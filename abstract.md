## I Don't Know What I'm Doing (And How I Found Out)

Whenever someone asks me "what I do", and I tell them that "I program computers"- they usually: visibly increase their estimation of my mental faculties by pronouncing me "smart", while gleefully proclaiming their ignorance (and/or lack of inherent aptitude).

"I could never program computers," they say, "you must be _sooo_ smart," they say.

To which I reply that "programming computers isn't really _all_ that hard. I mean, it's kind of like, if you wrote down instructions for baking a chocolate cake, gave them to an 8 year old and waited for the results from the kitchen. Which you then have to eat, to figure out if you've gotten the recipe right. Otherwise, you revise your recipe, rinse and repeat."

(And I know that many more people have read and followed recipes that have ever attempted to write one, but, you've read a recipe, you've seen a super abstract painting, and thought: "I could totally do that", right?)

Anyway, that usually gets a laugh and then maybe we talk about other things. 

The analogy I _really_ want to make, about what my job is _really_ like, though, is something "like, if you're Gordon Ramsay on Hell's Kitchen Nightmare Chopped, but the meal takes weeks to cook, your sous chefs all live in different timezones, and you can only communicate over text messages."

Which can sometimes definitely feel not dissimilar to getting an 8 year old to bake you a chocolate cake using only WhatsApp.

My talk is primarily about answering the following questions:
* What _do_ I do anyway?
    * What I did today
    * What I have done
    * What I'm supposed to be doing
    * What I want to be doing
    * What my next doing should be

Along the way I'll share my humble opinions on:
* The duality of knowability and teachability
* Whether programming computers is hard or not
* Some strategies for levelling up, professionally
